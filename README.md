# Sorting-Algorithms
Implemented different sorting algorithms to calculate runtimes for Design and Analysis of Algorithms class.

Fully implemented in Python3, using Tkinter for the GUI and a PRNG to generate default datasets.

### Datasets included:
All Datasets generated pseudorandomly in range of 0 to 5000000.
- 5000 numbers 
- 25000 numbers
- 80000 numbers
- 150000 numbers
- 300000 numbers

## What I've learned from this:
- How to work with different sorting algorithms.
- How Python's runtime for large datasets with O(n^2) algorithms is significantly slower than the implementations in lower-level languages such as C++.
- To use a simple Tkinter GUI for dataset and algorithm selection.
